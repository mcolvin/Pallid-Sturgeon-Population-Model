Colvin, and othersâ€¦ 2017-02-22 Preface This is work in progress, results are provisional and subject to change. Do not used or cite this material in any way Structure of the book 0.1 Some stuff River bends, defined as a outer bend and crossover were used to simulate spatial dynamics. The location of individual Pallid Sturgeon were tracked during each time step and moved to a new bend, conditional on survival and previous bend location assuming a multinomial distirubtion as, Loc_{j,t+t}~Multinomial(p_{I,.,t} Where varibles and indices are defined in table xx. The vector of probabilities \\(p_{I,.,t}\\) predicts the probable location given the previous bend location. This approach to movement provided a flexible approach to modeling movement that can be readily related to management actions. Specifically, $p_{I,j,t} is an array of probabilities with each row summing to one forming a 12 transition matrices providing the probability of moving from bend \\(i\\) to bend \\(j\\). This array of probabilities provides a plugin location for movement. The diagonal represents the probability of remaining in the same reach, off diagonal elements represent downstream or upstream movements. 0.2 Management effects on movement The effect of management actions on movement or drift of adult or larval Pallid Sturgeion respectively can be simulated by modifying monthly transition matrices. For example, suppose that adult Pallid Sturgeon migrate upstream given a flow or temperature cue. This directed movement can be simulated by specifying the probability of a fish moving to downstream bends equal to 0 and upstream bends greather than 0. Similarly, the effect of flow on free embryo drift can be simulated with increased downstream probabilities. \\(Y_{I,j,t+1}=\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot Q_{I,j,t}\\) for i&lt;=j i&gt;j = 0 Current model implementation requires an array of transitions for each timestep. Future model versions will attempt to reefing the linke between environmental covariates like flow such that a time series of predicted flows can be used as as inputs. The relationship between movement and varying covariates may take the form of a model prediction given previous location. For example, movement in terms of kilometers could be modeled \\(rkm_{t+1} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot Q + \\beta_2 \\cdot rkm_t + \\beta_3 \\cdot Q \\cdot rkm_t + \\sigma\\). The equation predicts how far, on average, a pallid sturgeon will move given an effect of flow and current location. The interaction term accounts for the effect of location (i.e., fish cannot move as far if they are near the uppermost bends). 0.3 Effects on survival Modeling the effect of management actions on survival is specified by a logistic equation. Specifically, the base survivals are simulated using the equation \\(\\Phi_{stage} = \\frac{exp(\\beta_0)}{1+exp(\\beta_0)}\\), Where \\(\\beta_0\\) represents the expected survival on logit scale. For example, adult survival is expected 0.4 Allee effect A FUNCTION THAT PRODUCES AN ALLEE EFFECT MODIFYING GAMETE FERTILIZATAION SUCCESS B0=0.49 B1=0.72 D&lt;- seq(0:1000) y&lt;- B1*log(D)+B0 y&lt;- exp(y) plot(D,y,ylab=&quot;Fertilization success&quot;, xlab=&quot;Density (fish/rkm)&quot;) "]
