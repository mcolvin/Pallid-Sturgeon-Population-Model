## Analysis overview 

This analysis was initiated to evaluate and verify trends in size structure indexed by proportional size distributions (PSD) using the Pallid Sturgeon model developed as part of the effects analysis.  

## Relevant analysis methods^1^


1. Adult population initialized in with 43,012 fish.  All fish assumed to be hatchery origin, this assumption is inconsequential in the model for this exercise
2. These fish were randomly assigned a length from the empirical distribution of lengths calculated from PSPAP assessments for RPMA2
3. Survival was set to 0.95 for ages 1-60 (max age)
4. There was no natural recruitment or stocking
5. PSD values calculated given standard PSD sizes for Pallid Sturgeon
6. Growth (i.e., change in length over time) and weight of individuals was simulated using RPMA2 specific VBGF
parameters and length-weight relationship estimated from PSPAP data.
7. Total biomass over time was calculated as the sum of the weight of all individuals at a given time step.
8. Simulations run over a 50 year period, monthly time steps, 100 stochastic replicates

## Provisional results^2^

* Incremental PSD values transitioned from the majority of Pallid Sturgeon being PSD-SQ to PSD-QP (Figure 1; Table 1). 
Size structure shifts to larger fish with higher relative frequencies due to survival and growth.
* Increases in PSD-PM, PSD-MT, and PSD-T were observed in simulations, although size
structure stabilized around 2045 (Figure 1).
* Total biomass of RPMA2 is projected to exceed 60,000 kg by 2030 given model inputs (Figure 2). Biomass declines after
peak biomass due to the interaction of growth and survival (i.e., number of biomass lost to senescence exceeds growth).
* Total abundance is expected to decrease to approximately 3,300 individuals over the next 50 years 
given model inputs (Figure 3)
