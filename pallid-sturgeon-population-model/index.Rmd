# Initialization

## Age-0 Pallid Sturgeon

* Take number of age-0 fish and allocate them from
multinomial
* If no spatial component, allocate all to a single reach
* If spatial then allocate among all reaches given a vector
of probabilities
* Currently these probability's are random _need to allocate
as a function of spawning reaches_
