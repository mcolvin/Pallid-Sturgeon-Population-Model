### Background

<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service recently initiated an effects analysis (EA) for the Missouri River Recovery Program (MRRP).  The EA was strongly encouraged by the Missouri River Recovery Implementation Committee (MRRIC) and the MRRIC Independent Science Advisory Committee (ISAP) as a means to review recovery progress, provide quantitative models relating endangered speciesâ€™ responses to management actions, provide a foundation for structured decision making, and to create a framework for continued monitoring and assessment through adaptive management. </p>
