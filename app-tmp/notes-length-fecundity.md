Notes on the length-fecundity relationship.  The assumed relationship is 

$Fecundity = a\cdot Length^b + \epsilon$  

where, $\epsilon \sim Lognormal(0,\sigma)$  The solid line above the expected functional relationship of length and fecundity.  The grey area denotes the uncertainty around the expected values.
