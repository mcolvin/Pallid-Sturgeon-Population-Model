## About the model 

### Quick start
The grey box to the left provides a dropdown to work through model inputs grouped by relevant inputs (see the groupings below for an overview).  The model has default inputs, however if inputs need to be modified use the dropdown menu to access those model inputs.  Selecting "10. Run" will render the page to modify simulation inputs (i.e., number of replicates, number of years) and button to execute the model.  


### Parameter modules

The parameter modules below are where you can go and modify the default paramaeter inputs, organized by biological and model relevance.  The last module, provides a button for you to submit inputs and execute the model.  While the model is running there will be a progress bar located near the top of the window and a graphical output of the simulated population dyanamics will be returned.

1. Default- This page
2. Population characteristics
3. Weight-length
4. Fecundity-length
5. Growth
6. Sexual maturity and return to spawning
7. Survival:  input 
8. Initialization of age and spatial structure: defines how individuals are allocated among age classes and river bends.
9. Stocking amount: this page modifies the number and timing of stocked Pallid Sturgeon
10. Run: This is where you submit the inputs and run the model.
