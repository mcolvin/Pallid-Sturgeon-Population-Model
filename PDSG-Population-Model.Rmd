## Methods

###Study area and geographic scope
Pallid Sturgeon historically occupied the thousands of kilometers of the Missouri River and its tributaries (Figure 1).  The historically contiguous stream habitat was fragmented by dams sited on the Missouri River and its major tributaries.  Specifically, five dams were constructed without fish passage on the Missouri River during the mid-1900s to provide flood control, navigation, irrigation, hydroelectric, and recreational services.  In 1905 a large diversion dam was placed on the Yellowstone River approximately 113 km upstream from the confluence with the Missouri River.   Five stream segments emerged on the Missouri River from dam placements including:  RPMA4) the lower basin extending 1298 km from the confluence with the Mississippi River to Gavins Point Dam (rkm 0 to 1298), RPMA3) the segmented reach extending 926 km and containing Gavins Point, Big Bend, Oahe, and Garrison Dams (rkm 1298 to 2224), and RPMA 2) the upper basin (611 km) containing the Missouri River upstream of Garrison Dam (rkm 2224 to 2835) and the Yellowstone River from the confluence with the Missouri River to intake dam (rkm 0 to 112), and RPMA1) the Missouri River upstream of Fort Peck Dam (rkm xxxx) (Figure 2).  Naturally produced Pallid Sturgeon are believed to be few or functionally extirpated in the segmented reach of the Missouri River (RPMA 3) because of insufficient spawning and larval drift habitat [cite?].  Therefore recovery efforts described in this study are restricted to RPMA 4 and 2 (hereafter referred to as lower and upper basin respectively) which provide the geographic boundaries and spatial organization of this model.  

### Model overview and spatial organization

The conceptual population model structure was developed to meet three objectives: 1) provide a quantitative framework to forecast pallid sturgeon population dynamics given inputs and life history stages from the CEMs described by Jacobson et al. (2014) (Table 1), 2) provide a flexible model structure template that can be used to model upper and lower basin populations, and 3) account for whether a pallid sturgeon were produced in the Missouri River System or the hatchery system (Figure 2).  A secondary consideration in the development of the model structure was the availability of biological data commonly collected during population assessments (e.g., size, weight, age, sex, origin), which will be necessary to parameterize the model and allow the model to inform monitoring efforts.  

The model is an individual based model of Pallid Sturgeon populations in RPMA2 and 4.  The upper and lower bounds of RPMA 2 and 4 provide the spatial extent of the model simulations.  The spatial grain are river bends used by the population assessment program (PSPAP) (Welker and Drobish 2012b, a).  Bends are defined as three contiguous habitat units, a channel cross-over, inside bend, and outside bend.  Bends begin on the upriver point at the main channel cross-over macrohabitat, ending just above the downstream main channel cross-over. There are 156 and 316 bends defined for RPMA 2 and 4 respectively.   Mean length of bends of RPMA 4 was 4.0 km (varying from 0.16 to 19 km), and mean bend length in RPMA 2 was 2.3 km (varying from 0.64 to 8.0 km).  

### Model overview
Core and plugins, spatially explicit (yes/no), recruitment (yes/no)…

#### Stage-structured cohort models
We used cohorts organized by early life history stages as a framework to 
model population dynamics (Figure 2). Seven stages were used in the 
model to capture biologically important pallid sturgeon stage 
transitions similar to those identified by Wildhaber et al. (2011) and 
correspond to life stage-specific CEMs (Jacobson et al. 2014) (Table 1). 
Pallid Sturgeon life history in the Missouri River System was organized 
into stages defined in Table 1. We modeled Pallid Sturgeon population 
dynamics by transitioning groups or individual fish from one life stage 
to another in a directed fashion illustrated in Figure 2. Within the 
model life stages occurring before age-1 were treated as cohorts and 
once a cohort reached age-1 the number in that cohort was expanded to 
represent individuals. This approach treats life stages prior to age-1 
as super individuals and was used for computation efficiency (Scheffer 
et al. 1995). The number of fish transitioned from one stage to another 
stage was modified by a probability (e.g., survival, maturation). 


#### Cohort dynamics (Eggs, Embryos, Free embryos, and age-0 )
Early life stages were modeled as cohorts
Eggs

\[{{[Eggs]}_{bend}}\tilde{\ }\sum\nolimits_{i=1}^{I}{Poisson({{\gamma }_{i,bend}}\cdot [Adults])}\] 	(1)

where
* $[Eggs]$ is the number of eggs produced in a bend,
* $i$ indexes individual fish,
* $\gamma$ is the number of eggs produced by adult $i$,
* $[Adults]$ is an adult Pallid Sturgeon, and
* $bend$ indexes which bend the Pallid Sturgeon is located in .  

Embryos are fertilized oocytes. In its simplest form the number of 
embryos at time t was modeled the contribution of natural and hatchery 
origin spawns as: 


${{[Embryos]}_{cohort}}\tilde{\ }Binomial({{[Eggs]}_{_{cohort}}},~{{\phi }_{T9,cohort,t}})$	(2)

where
$[Embryo]$ is the number of embryos,
$[Eggs]$ is the number of eggs,
${{\phi }_{T9}}$ is the survival probability, and 
$cohort$  indexes the cohort.

Free embryos represent embryos that have escaped predation and other sources of mortality and hatched.  These dynamics occur within a short period of time, week-month, and therefore the number of embryos at time $t$ was modeled as a function of the number of as:

${{[Free\,embryos]}_{cohort}}\tilde{\ }Binomial({{[Embryos]}_{cohort}},{{\phi }_{T2,cohort,t}})$ 	(3)
	
where 
$[Free\,embryos]$ is the number of free embryos in a cohort,
$[Embryos]$ is the number of embryos, 
$\phi_{T2}$ is the survival probability, and
$cohort$ indexes the cohort.

Exogenously feeding larvae pallid sturgeon represent the longest duration life stage modeled during the first year of life, lasting for months.  However this life stage still occurs within the first year of life and therefore the number of exogenously feeding larvae and age-0 at time t is a function of the number of free embryos at time Y as: 

${{[Age-0]}_{cohort}}\tilde{\ }binomial([Free\,embryos],{{\phi }_{T3,cohort}})$ 	(4)

where 
$\[[Ex.\,Feeding\,Larvae]\]$ 	is the number of exogenously feeding larvae in a cohort,
$[Free\,embryos]$ 	is the number of free embryos in a cohort,
$\phi_{T3}$ 	is the survival probability, and
$cohort$ 	indexes the cohort.

### Individual Pallid Sturgeon dynamics (age-1+) 

Keep track of Alive or not, Age in months, Reached sexual maturity, 
Spawn next year, Time since last spawn, location, len, weight . Things 
that vary over time and are indexed with a t Live or dead 



${{Z}_{i,t}}\tilde{\ }Bernoulli({{Z}_{i,t-1}}\cdot {{\phi }_{T8}})$ 	(5)

Maturity
Is a fish sexually mature? 

	${{M}_{i,t}}~\tilde{\ }Bernoulli({{Z}_{i,t-dt}}\cdot \max ({{M}_{i,t-dt}},Maturit{{y}_{i,t}}))$ 	(9)

Will a fish spawn in the next time step

	$SP{{N}_{i,t}}~\tilde{\ }Bernoulli({{Z}_{i,t-dt}}\cdot {{P}_{spawning,i,t}})$ 	(10)

where 
$SPN$ indicated whether a fish is ready to spawn,
$Z$  indicated whether a fish is alive or not,
${{P}_{spawining}}$	is the probability a fish will spawn in the next time step,
$i$ indexes individual fish, and
$t$ indexes time.

Model initialization
The model was initializing in three steps.  First, state variable were specified by stochastically drawing a number from a specified distribution and expanded to represent individual fish (Table xxx).  Second, individual fish were stochastically assigned length, sex, age, and time since last spawn.  Lastly, individuals were stochastically assigned to a river bend given a vector of probabilities calculated from PSPAP data.  Specific details about model initialization can be found in the supplemental information.   

	


## Initializing the model

2 types of data were required: 1) initial stage-specific population 
abundances, 2) demographic values (e.g., sex ratio), to initialize 
cohorts and indviduals 



Values of Age-0 survival required to achieve varying population growth rates ($\lambda$).  

$$\[A=\left[ \begin{matrix}
   0 & {{M}_{i}}\cdot R\cdot {{F}_{i}} & {{M}_{i}}\cdot R\cdot F & \ldots  & {{M}_{i}}\cdot R\cdot F & {{M}_{i}}\cdot R\cdot F  \\
   {{S}_{0}} & 0 & 0 & \ldots  & 0 & 0  \\
   0 & {{S}_{1}} & 0 & \ldots  & 0 & 0  \\
   0 & 0 & {{S}_{2+}} & 0 & 0 & 0  \\
   \vdots  & \ddots  & \ddots  & \ddots  & \ddots  & \ddots   \\
   0 & 0 & 0 & \ldots  & {{S}_{2+}} & 0  \\
\end{matrix} \right]\]
$$

## A framework for evaluating management effects
While this analysis does not explicitly evaluate the effects of specific 
management actions like flow modifications or habitat creations, the 
model was developed such that these effects could be evaluated given 
appropriate inputs to the core population dynamics model, hereafter 
referred to as plugins as information is learned during adaptive 
management. 


### Plugin functions and values
Many sources were used to determine values required by equations 3.1 to 
3.11 and simulate pallid sturgeon population dynamics. Four types of 
data were required: 1) initial stage-specific population abundances, 2) 
demographic values (e.g., sex ratio), 3) demographic rates (e.g., 
survival), and 4) demographic functions (e.g., maturity, fecundity). 
Initial stage-specific abundances for upper and lower basin natural and 
hatchery origin populations used to initialize the population model can 
be found in Table 3.2. Survival estimates and associated range of 
uncertainties and sources used in the simulation model are found in 
Table 3.3. Additional demographic values (e.g., sex ratio), 
uncertainties and sources are found in Table 3.1. Functions relating age 
or time since an event were required to predict additional age or time 
dependent demographic rates. In the simulation model, fecundity (eggs 
per female) was predicted as a function of age (Figure 4) using the 
following: 

2) demographic values (e.g., sex ratio), 
3) demographic rates (e.g., survival)

### Age-0 survival
For early life history stages where no survival estimates exist, 
survivals were randomly selected such that the product equaled age-0 
survival (S_(a=0)). Stage-specific initial abundances were randomly 
selected from triangular distributions generated from minimum, expected, 
and maximum values reported in Tables 3.2 and 3.3. Age-specific 
abundances within each age-class were then stochastically generated 
assuming a stable age distribution. Once fish were allocated to 
age-classes within the adult stage, they were uniformly allocated among 
spawning and recrudescent stages. 

## Evaluating population dynamics and stocking scenarios

### Simulating population dynamics

## Scenarios
The parameterized model was also used to evaluate several scenarios and 
address three questions regarding the upper and lower basin pallid 
sturgeon populations. 


1) What is the population growth rate ($\lambda$) under: A) present 
stocking conditions, and B) No stocking? 

This scenario was evaluated using the same steps of the sensitivity 
analysis with the exception that an additional scenario was added where 
stocking values were set to zero and simulated for the upper and lower 
basin populations. A stochastic growth rate $\lambda$ was calculated for each 
of the 10k replicates as the geometric mean of within replicate annual 
growth rates. 

2) How far to move early life history survival to achieve $\lambda$ ≥ 1 without stocking?

Early life history survival is an important determinant of population 
growth rate and dynamics in fish populations. The use of population 
supplementation can circumvent poor survival of early life history 
stages and maintain or increase population abundances. In this scenario 
the question of how high does early life history survival need to be in 
order to maintain or increase the population (i.e., $\lambda$ ≥ 1) in the 
absence of stocking. This question was evaluated by performing a grid 
search of values for S1 and S_(A=0) (S_(A=0)=S2⋅S3⋅S4). Specifically 
S1 was evaluated for values of 0.001 to 0.003 by increments of 0.002 and 
S_(A=0) was evaluated for values of 0.01 to 0.1 by increments of 0.01 
for the upper and lower basin populations. Stocking values were set at 0 
and the population simulated for a 100 year period. We simulated 100 
replicate model runs for each unique combination of S1 and S_(A=0). The 
mean stochastic $\lambda$ and proportion of the 100 replicates with a mean 
stochastic $\lambda$ ≥ 1 calculated for each combination of S1 and S_(A=0). 
Results were visually assessed for each parameter combination as a 
binary response, whether 95% of the 100 replicates had a stochastic $\lambda$ 
≥ 1. 

## Sensitivity

A sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate the effect of parameter 
uncertainty on population dynamics simulated for the lower and upper 
Missouri River basins. The sensitivity analysis was performed by 
randomly drawing parameters within parameter extremes assuming 
triangular distributions. Randomly selected values were used to 
initialize the population model and the population simulated over a 100 
year period. Population abundance at year 100 was retained for juvenile 
and adult stages of hatchery and natural origin. This process was 
replicated 10k times to capture parameter variability. Yearling stocking 
was set to the basin-specific average values, it was assumed for this 
analysis that fingerling stocking will not continue due to low survival. 
Model parameter values were then assigned to quantiles (0-25, 25-50, 
50-75, and 75-100%). Stage- and origin-specific expected abundances 
(i.e., mean) were calculated for each quantile and used to construct 
tornado plots to visualize how parameter uncertainty contributes to 
variation in abundances at t = 50. Tornado plots are a useful tool for 
visualizing the effect of parameters on model output, population 
abundance at t = 50 in this case, and are commonly used evaluate model 
sensitivity (Conroy and Peterson 2013). 

## Results

### Sensitivities

Stage-specific sensitivity analyses for expected population abundance in 
year 100 varied between upper and lower Missouri River pallid sturgeon 
populations simulated. The expected number of natural origin adults in 
year 100 was most sensitive to early life history survival for the upper 
basin, and a mix of hatchery origin adult abundance, early life history 
survivals and sex ratio for the lower basin (Figure 3.7). Similar 
patterns of parameter sensitivity resulted for natural origin juveniles 
(Figure 3.8). Hatchery origin adults and juvenile sensitivities also 
varied between basin with juvenile survival playing a role in upper 
basin population dynamics, and a mix of factors in the lower basin 
(Figure 3.9 and 3.10). Similarly sensitivity results varied between 
basin for total population abundance, with a stronger influence of 
hatchery supplementation in lower basin, followed by early life history 
survival, sex ratio, adult abundance (i.e., factors linked in embryo 
production) (Figure 3.10). While the upper basin dynamics were sensitive 
to early life history survival and sex ratio. 

### Scenarios 
1) What is the population growth rate ($\lambda$) under: A) present 
stocking conditions, and B) No stocking? 


Population dynamics given the degree of uncertainties in model 
parameters exhibited variable dynamics. Under average stocking 
scenarios, populations tended to increase for all stages and basins 
(Figures 3.12 to 3.15). The majority of replicates tended to decline 
over the 100 year simulations for natural origin juvenile and adult 
stage pallid sturgeons with the cessation of stocking, especially after 
existing hatchery origin fish senescence out of the systems (Figures 3.12 
and 3.13). There were certain parameter combinations that resulted in 
increasing abundance of natural origin fish under no stocking scenarios. 
As expected, hatchery origin fish abundance decline to 0 over the 100 
year simulations (Figures 3.13 and 3.14). Evaluating distributions of 
growth rates for each scenario, all stocking scenarios had a growth rate 
greater than 1 (Figure 3.16). With the cessation of stocking, upper 
basin simulations were more likely to have a growth rate less than 1 and 
approximately 50% of the simulations for the lower basin had growth 
rates less than 1. 

2) How far to move early life history survival to achieve $\lambda$ ≥ 
1 without stocking? 


There was uncertainty in how much critical survival parameters need to 
increase in order to achieve a population growth rate greater than 1. 
Varying combinations of S1 and S_(A=0) can achieve a population growth 
rate greater than 1 given the parameters used to model the population. 
In general, simulations indicated that combinations of S1 exceeding 
0.0012 and S_(A=0) exceeding 0.02 for the upper basin and S1 exceeding 
0.001 and S_(A=0) exceeding 0.02 for the lower basin resulted in 
positive population growth under stocking conditions simulated. 

3) Depensation effect can we assess population needed to get past 
critical depensation? 



The population model was flexible enough to accommodate evaluation of a 
depensation scenario relating spawning population abundance to embryo 
production. But to reiterate the underlying functional relationship 
relating a depensatory effect of spawning population abundance on embryo 
production is uncertain and results are therefore unreliable. Relative 
to previous stocking and no stocking scenarios, simulating the same 
scenarios including a depensatory effect of population size on embryo 
production resulted in lower total population abundances and reduced 
population growth rates (Figure 3.6).
